# max3232_pcb
diy single sided pcb for max3232 RS232 to TTL serial

After cheap max3232 pcb was broken i have placed components with the addtion of 3.3k resistors on rs232 inputs on a diy pcb.

Why 3.3k resistors? because these cheap max3232 clones cause crosstalk while connected to a PC RS232 port. 
This was en effective solution. And with the new pcb i added rts and cts.
